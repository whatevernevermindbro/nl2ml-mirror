They represent an important group to GCA, since the longer someone goes without donating, the less likely  they will be to give again. Therefore, recapture of these former donors is a critical aspect of GCA's fund raising efforts. The analysis file includes all 95,412 Lapsed donors who received the mailing, with responders to the mailing marked with a flag in the TARGET_B field. The overall response rate for this direct mail promotion is around 5%. The package cost (including the mail cost) is $0.85 per piece mailed. (\n"

            "To study the structure and evolution of the Universe astronomers try to draw a 3D map of galaxy distribution. to the theoretical rest frame values one can get the redshift. This very low resolution spectrum (so called photometry) carry some information on the redshift of the galaxy, but the fine (few Angstrom wide) spectral line is  smeared out several hundred times. Forgetting astronomy the description of the task is simple: you get 5 numbers, the 5 intensity values in 5 wide optical bands, and you have to estimate a 6-th number, the redshift. We assume that is we have a large enough, representative reference, or \"training\"  set, where both photometry and redshift are known, we can get deduce some relation between them and use this to estimate redshift for other galaxies. ( The traditional methods either \"blind\" machine learning techniques (polynomial fitting, neural networks, random forests, etc) or try to mimic the true underlying physical process. This last column will not be used in the evaluation process (you can fill it  up with all 0-s if you do not have estimate) but we will review them at the end of the class. Note, that your public score is calculated from 10% of the query set - to avoid iterative over-learning - , the final score for the whole query set will be provided  at the end of the competition.\n"

As the name suggests the direct way of redshift measurement is through spectroscopy. This very low resolution spectrum (so called photometry) carry some information on the redshift of the galaxy, but the fine (few Angstrom wide) spectral line is smeared out several hundred times. You get the training set with 5 magnitude values ( -2.5*log10(brightness) ) and their measurement error estimates and the redshifts. Yes, of course no measurements are accurate, so the magnitudes are not precise, and as we go to fainter galaxies (larger magnitude!)

You will be using the Matconvnet package to perform 100-class classification on the CIFAR dataset. Therefore, you will need to upload the prediction csv file to Kaggle to figure out the prediction accuracy. The program will also generate an imdb.mat file for you, which is stored under code\\mnist_data\\mnist-baseline directory. In addition, please go through macros written in the .m files. Steps for the CIFAR dataset Walk through the example code Before you design your own architecture, you should get familiar with the architecture defined by others, the meaning of hyper-parameters and the function of each layer. Layer parameters in matconvnet can be found in vl_simplenn.m. It should match the accuracy achieved by your best submission to the Kaggle competition. As in the past MPs, discuss your development process and any interesting implementation choices. For each layer, list the layer functions, their parameters, input dimensions and output dimensions.

Унарные потенциалы Подсчёт унарных потенциалов необходимо реализовать с помощью нейросети, принимающей на вход небольшую область изображения размером от 7x7 до 13x13 и возвращающей вектор длины 2 вероятностей принадлежности центрального пикселя этой области к фону и объекту. Нейросеть рекомендуется делать на основе комбинации из нескольких сверточных слоев и, при необходимости, pooling-слоя с добавлением полносвязных слоёв и softmax в конце.\n"

Its surface is at about 9600 degrees Kelvin, and its spectrum is roughly that of a 9600K black-body, with absorption due to molecules in its atmosphere. Because of this fact, characteristic patterns in the spectrum of a distant star can be used to infer its chemical composition! For historical reasons, astronomers report the flux using the magnitude system, where the magnitude is defined by \\[ u = -2.5 \\log_{10}\\left[\\frac{f_u}{3631 Jy}\\right] \\] The denominator is a normalization constant, measured in Janskys. In this competition, we pull ~1,500,000 objects from SDSS spectroscopic database and the SDSS photometric images. Quasars, also commonly referred to as QSOs (Quasi-Stellar Objects) or AGNs (Active Galactic Nuclei) are galaxies which contain supermassive black holes at their core. From these images alone, it would be impossible to distinguish between the star and the quasar: both are unresolved point-sources of similar apparent brightness.

Embedding emails in Euclidean  Space The first challenge you face is how to systematically embed text data (such as an email) in a Euclidean space. Say, an example text document *t* is: John likes to watch football. While such an embedding is extremely useful, a severe drawback of such an embedding is that it treats similar meaning words (e.g. `watch`, `watches`, `watched`, `watching`, etc.) There is only one goal for this assignment, develop a spam classifier that has the best prediction accuracy on the test data!

This very low resolution spectrum (so called photometry) carry some information on the redshift of the galaxy, but the fine (few Angstrom wide) spectral line is  smeared out several hundred times. Forgetting astronomy the description of the task is simple: you get 5 numbers, the 5 intensity values in 5 wide optical bands, and you have to estimate a 6-th number, the redshift. We assume that is we have a large enough, representative reference, or \"training\"  set, where both photometry and redshift are known, we can get deduce some relation between them and use this to estimate redshift for other galaxies.

For this homework, you need to install and try out the SNAP network analysis tools. We strongly encourage you to use Snap.py for Python (available from http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/). The number of undirected edges in the network, i.e., the number of unique unordered pairs (a, b), a 6 = b, for which (a, b) ∈ E or (b, a) ∈ E (or both). The number of nodes with fewer than 10 incoming edges (in-degree < 10). Using one of the network analysis tools above, load the StackOverflow network. This value can be calculated in Snap.py via function GetWccs. IDs of the top 3 most central nodes in the network by PagePank scores.\n"

            "Attention: according to the competition rules, the winning teams on private data, that will be invited to present their solutions at the conference, were determined in September, 18th. It involves classifying images captured by a monitoring station installed at the UNIVAP (University of Vale do Paraíba) astronomy observatory, at São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. This station composes one of the monitoring stations of the EXOSS Citizen Science organization. This Brazilian non-profit organization aims to monitor meteors (popularly kown as shooting stars) which cross the southern skies. The system records a video and also an image which is a composition of the video frames, which will be used at the competition. Features The following features were extracted from the images: - AutoColorCorrelogram (features X1 to X768) We define a new image feature called the color correlogram and use it for image indexing and comparison. This feature distills the spatial correlation of colors, and is both effective and inexpensive for content-based image retrieval. More info: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-79547-6_30 - ColorHistogram (features X913 to X976) A RGB/HSB histogram. FCTH size is limited to 72 bytes per image, rendering this descriptor suitable for use in large image databases. Whether considering the intensity or grayscale values of the image or various dimensions of color, the co-occurrence matrix can measure the texture of the image. Histograms: Gray-Histogram, RGB-Histogram and HSB-Histogram. # More info: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/576366/ - MeanPatchIntensityHistogram (features X2880 to X3135) This descriptor calculates a histogram of mean intensities of specified neighborhood size. The histogram intervals for the opponent color space have ranges different from the RGB model. # In this descriptor, canny edge extraction is applied prior to extracting the gradients. The parameters for the canny operator are also taken from the properties file. # More info: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-772/multiclust2011-paper7.pdf - Tamura (features X3434 to X3451) This descriptor is one of texture implementations and include three Tamura's features.\n"

But we are also providing you with a secondary data set that contains the unprocessed metadata, because we'd like to encourage you to dig deeper into the problem and use statistical analysis to find out what it is about a package that predicts whether it will be installed by the average user of a programming language.

            "This is Assignment 4 for the Machine Learning course (COL-774) at IIT Delhi (Semester II, 2018-19). Each time the ball hits a brick you get a positive score and goal of the player is to score as many points as possible by breaking the bricks (hence the name \"Breakout\"). See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfFTbDuEBss) video for a quick visualization of the game. For example, you will get +1 reward in below transition:      ![ Note that, because each reward corresponds to a transition of one frame to another so the number of rewards will be one less than the number of frames in the sequence. The task:** You are playing this game on a very old television that sometimes does not display some frame. Then, at testing time you will be given any 4 random frames (still in sequence) out of  \\\\(f_{t-6}, f_{t-5}, f_{t-4}, f_{t-3}, f_{t-2}, f_{t-1}\\\\) and frame \\\\(f_{t}\\\\) will always be given to you. You can read about f-measure [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score)  (the metric is referred to as F1 score). Deadline: <23 April 2019, 11:50 pm> (Buffer days allowed for this part only) **(A) PCA + SVM : [10 points] [Scikit-learn]:** Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the given datasets (for images in first 50 episodes) using scikit-learn library and use the top 50 dimensions obtained using PCA. [Here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) is a short tutorial on how to use Pytorch. Report your training and test accuracies for this architecture. For competition, you can use whatever pre-processing you like (including complex feature extraction).** ---------- Submission Guidelines: **Code:** You need to submit separate code for each part on moodle.

It is crucial for us to have a means to distinguish different sounds in speech that may or may not represent the same letter or combinations of letters in the written alphabet. For this challenge we will consider 46 phonemes in the english language. [\" +BREATH+\", \"+COUGH+\", \"+NOISE+\", \"+SMACK+\", \"+UH+\", \"+UM+\", \"AA\", \"AE\", \"AH\", \"AO\", \"AW\", \"AY\", \"B\", \"CH\", \"D\", \"DH\", \"EH\", \"ER\", \"EY\", \"F\", \"G\", \"HH\", \"IH\", \"IY\", \"JH\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"NG\", \"OW\", \"OY\", \"P\", \"R\", \"S\", \"SH\", \"SIL\", \"T\", \"TH\", \"UH\", \"UW\", \"V\", \"W\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"ZH\"] A powerful technique in speech recognition is to model speech as a markov process with unobserved states. Your task is to instead take a model-free approach and classify mel spectrogram frames using a neural network that takes a frame (plus optional context) and outputs class probabilities for all 138 phoneme states. By looking only at the amplitude of the signal of the orchestra over time, it is nearly impossible to distinguish one source from another.

Also, the official WiDS 2019 Datathon Participant Form and opportunity to be eligible for additional prizes is now up at http://bit.ly/WiDSdatathon2019form Why oil palm? Because oil palm grows only in tropical environments, the crop’s expansion has led to deforestation, increased carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss, while at the same time providing many valuable jobs. Participants can be students, faculty, government workers, members of NGOs, or industry members. The datathon task is to train a model that takes as input a satellite image and outputs a prediction of how likely it is that the image contains an oil palm plantation.\n"

Training a classifier model When you have your transformed \"X\" and \"y\" data, it is split into training data and testing data using the function train_test_split .

Your task is to instead take a model-free approach and classify mel spectrogram frames using a neural network that takes a frame (plus optional context) and outputs class probabilities for all 138 phoneme states. By looking only at the amplitude of the signal of the orchestra over time, it is nearly impossible to distinguish one source from another.

Embedding emails in Euclidean  Space The first challenge you face is how to systematically embed text data (such as an email) in a Euclidean space. Say, an example text document *t* is: John likes to watch football. While such an embedding is extremely useful, a severe drawback of such an embedding is that it treats similar meaning words (e.g. `watch`, `watches`, `watched`, `watching`, etc.) There is only one goal for this assignment, develop a spam classifier that has the best prediction accuracy on the test data!

Remove and add data transformations to the pipeline as you wish. By default, your data contains same words written in different cases, and for example special punctuation characters, numbers, etc. What information would you use to identify manually if a message was written by Mikko? Transform the words and remove the ones you don't consider useful. label 0 0 1 0 Here the third message was written by MikkoM. Training a classifier model When you have your transformed \"X\" and \"y\" data, it is split into training data and testing data using the function train_test_split . This kind of model does not do anything useful, so we need to use a better metric, based on the rate of true positive and false positive predictions. Since we are predicting the probability of each message being written by Minkkinen, your submission should be in the following format: id user 1 0.023 2 0.343 3 0.992 4 0.001 The id column should range from 1 to 26652, and the user column from 0-1.\n"

This [survey data EDA][4] provides an overview of the industry on an aggregate scale, but it also leaves us wanting to know more about the many specific communities comprised within the survey. The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations. Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? If a country or territory received less than 50    respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for    anonymity. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was    approximately 10 minutes. - Multiple choice single response questions fit into individual columns whereas multiple choice multiple response questions were split into multiple columns.\n"

Stripper wells are attractive to a company due to their low operational costs and low capital intensity - ultimately providing a source of steady cash flow to fund operations that require more funds to get off the ground. Using this data, can we predict failures that occur both on the surface and below the ground? The kernel provides us with your code and output in addition to answers for the prompts in the \"Kernels Requirements\" section.\n"

            "Welcome to the admission test for the Intelligent Systems Strand of the M.Sc in Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin. Hence, the test will give you an idea of what to expect during your studies. To do the test, please follow the instructions as outlined in the remainder. When being asked for a \"Full name\", \"user name\" or \"display name\", use the anonymous ID that you have received via email. If you are not familiar with machine learning, we suggest having a look at these tutorials https://www.google.com/search?q=linear+regression+python+tutorial+income+prediction. If your model performs equally on your local data and the public test data, then chances are high that you will receive a similar score on the private board. # Final Submission Once you are satisfied with your scores, or the deadline has approached, send your source code (e.g. Python, R, or a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb) via email to Prof Joeran Beel, Strand Lead of Intelligent Systems https://www.scss.tcd.ie/joeran.beel/contact/. Please mention your Trinity application ID and your anonymous Kaggle ID in the email. On the one hand, any such type of cheating can lead you to be expelled from Trinity College Dublin. On the other hand, if you have difficulties in completing this test (and the other tests), chances are that you will fail the assignments and exams later at TCD.\n"

As such, the final criterion for annotation of non-information is defined as follows: “non-information is a comment that is completely uninformative and hence useless/should be removed (in the perspective of documentation decluttering)”. To qualify for inclusion [in the workshop proceedings](https://dysdoc.github.io/docgen2/index.html), participants must prepare a 4 page report describing their approach and lessons learned.

            "Frame Level Classification of Speech In this challenge you will take your knowledge of feedforward neural networks and apply it to a more useful task than recognizing handwritten digits: speech recognition. You are provided a dataset of audio recordings (utterances) and their phoneme state (subphoneme) labels. [\"+BREATH+\", \"+COUGH+\", \"+NOISE+\", \"+SMACK+\", \"+UH+\", \"+UM+\", \"AA\", \"AE\", \"AH\", \"AO\", \"AW\", \"AY\", \"B\", \"CH\", \"D\", \"DH\", \"EH\", \"ER\", \"EY\", \"F\", \"G\", \"HH\", \"IH\", \"IY\", \"JH\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"NG\", \"OW\", \"OY\", \"P\", \"R\", \"S\", \"SH\", \"SIL\", \"T\", \"TH\", \"UH\", \"UW\", \"V\", \"W\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"ZH\"] A powerful technique in speech recognition is to model speech as a markov process with unobserved states. By looking only at the amplitude of the signal of the orchestra over time, it is nearly impossible to distinguish one source from another. Thus, we get 100 40-dimensional mel spectral (row) vectors per second of speech in the recording. The details of how mel spectrograms are computed from speech is explained here . Data Files You can find the training and test data under the 'Data' tab Optional Readings Read the Implementation Details section for some tips and advice on building your classifier.\n"

This [survey data EDA][4] provides an overview of the industry on an aggregate scale, but it also leaves us wanting to know more about the many specific communities comprised within the survey. The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations. Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? If a country or territory received less than 50    respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for    anonymity. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was    approximately 10 minutes. - Multiple choice single response questions fit into individual columns whereas multiple choice multiple response questions were split into multiple columns.\n"

            "Введение В современном поисковом и интеллектуальном анализе данных часто требуется найти для сложных объектов некоторое компактное и удобное представление. Если в качестве аргументов подставить один и тот же объект, то расстояние равно нулю. d(obj1,obj2) — исходные расстояния между объектами (строгие формализмы используют здесь термин *различие* (dissimilarity), когда мы не требуем выполнения всех аксиом метрики), 2. Поскольку расстояния — это обычные вещественные числа, то на них есть всем привычное отношение порядка: одни расстояния больше других. Очевидно, что это квадратная симметричная матрица с нулями на главной диагонали. *Точечная конфигурация* — множество точек из \\\\( R^k \\\\),  где \\\\(k\\\\) — размерность пространства.

After this process is done for one image, it moves on to the next one and builds another convolved feature matrix. Thus, you’re trading specificity of your image’s features for a less computationally expensive model. Once at this point, you need to flatten your matrices (done by specifying a flatten layer) down into a single column vector so that we can feed that through a feed-forward neural network and apply back-propagation through every iteration of training (done via specifying a dense layer; will be shown in code). If you increase it to two, the model trains your data once, then updates the weights of different features depending on how they performed on the first epoch, and then trains the data to your updated model.\n"

Students will walk through the data science process and learn how to build machine learning models on a simulated business problem, with a chance to prove their skills on the live leader board. To do this, they have provided you a dataset of existing customers who were either up-sold and/or cross-sold services with a list of other information and you must build an analytical model to be able to predict the likelihood of a customer being up-sold and/or cross-sold. If you are signing up through Kaggle, please refer to the SAS Viya For Learners Registration section for more details.\n"
